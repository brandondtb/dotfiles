# Brandon's dotfiles

All my important dotfiles, in one place. Should work okay on Linux and MacOS.

To setup:

1. Use zsh
2. Look over the list of required tools
3. Run `git submodule update --init`
4. Run the `install.sh` script

## What tools are included?

* zplug plugin manager
* pyenv & pyenv-virtualenv
* fnm

## What needs to be installed
* pyenv build prerequisites
* direnv
* neovim, emacs, tmux, as desired
* stylua
* black

* pyright
